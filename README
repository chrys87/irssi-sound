Irssi sound by:

Adds sounds to irssi for different events, E.g. public message and private message received.
This script uses sox to generate it's sounds, so make sure sox is somewhere in your path.
Place sound.pl in .irssi/scripts/
Then in irssi do:
/script load sound
If you want to autorun the script, place the script in or simlink to ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/


There is a basic install script, just run:
./install
This install script creates the folder ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun if it doesn't exist and simlinks the script to start automatically.
